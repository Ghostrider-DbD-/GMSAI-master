Update calls when spawning Air and UAV patrols to match new requirements of GMSCore 1.11 
    Done as of 11/7/25 in Verson 1.1

Reworking the blacklist / safezone / no agro zone system 
    Will need to tell GMSCore what safezones there are
    and whether to delete AI that wander into them 

Because of the rewrite of the waypoint system for patrols, a lot of variables that were passed are no longer needed
    Will remove these from the calls as I go through each patrol type.
